# AIML CA2: Database Management and Querying

This project focuses on designing and querying a relational database to manage and analyze model-related information.

## Objectives
- Define a robust database schema for managing employees, datasets, and other relevant entities.
- Write optimized SQL queries to retrieve actionable insights from the data.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Schema (`Create_Tables.sql`)
- Contains `CREATE TABLE` statements for:
  - **`employee`**: Stores details about employees, including unique IDs and contact information.
  - **`dataset`**: Stores metadata about datasets used in the system.
- Primary keys ensure data integrity and support efficient querying.

### 2. Data Queries (`queries.sql`)
- Includes optimized SQL queries for:
  - Counting fresh models versus fine-tuned models.
  - Identifying unassigned models in the system.

## Summary
This project demonstrates the application of SQL in database design and querying. It showcases the creation of relational tables and advanced data retrieval techniques for practical use cases.
